xoj2pdf batch converts Xournal .xoj files into .pdfs

*Usage*

<code>java -jar xoj2pdf.jar <input directory path> <output directory path></code>

xoj2pdf will convert all .xojs in the given input folder, placing the output in the given
destination folder (if a file is called hello.xoj it becomes hello.pdf, keeping its root name)

Note that you may have to wrap directory paths in quotes to avoid slash ambiguity (generally a good
idea to do this anyway)

*Download*

The current JAR is available from the downloads button on the top right

*Format support*

xoj2pdf is nowhere near mature, and this mainly just fills a personal requirement. As such, the format 
support is pretty abysmal at the moment.

* Basic strokes: *YES*  (some lines may appear slightly more angular than normal)
* Pressure sensitivity: *NO* (Currently uses first pressure value as entire stroke width)
* Highlighter: *NO*  (opacity seems to be ignored by gnujpdf)
* Text: *NO*
* Colours: *NO* (besides yellow at the moment)
* Eraser: *NO*  (appears a filled stroke areas)
* Background: *NO* (just white for now)
* Embedded PDFs: *NO* (no plans to support either)
