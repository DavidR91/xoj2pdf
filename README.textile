xoj2pdf batch converts Xournal .xoj files into .pdfs

*Usage*

<code>java -jar xoj2pdf.jar <input directory path> <output directory path></code>

xoj2pdf will convert all .xojs in the given input folder, placing the output in the given
destination folder (if a file is called hello.xoj it becomes hello.pdf, keeping its root name)

Note that you may have to wrap directory paths in quotes to avoid slash ambiguity (generally a good
idea to do this anyway)


*Entire directory trees (recursive mode)*

To use xoj2pdf to convert whole directory trees, use the -r switch like so:

<code>java -jar xoj2pdf.jar <input directory path> <output directory path> -r</code>

The directory structure (and all nested directories) will be built as an exact mirror
rooted at the given output path. The only difference being that each .xoj will of course
be a PDF in the output folders


*Download*

The current JAR is available from the downloads button on the top right

*Format support*

xoj2pdf is nowhere near mature, and this mainly just fills a personal requirement. As such, the format 
support is pretty abysmal at the moment.

* Basic strokes: *YES*  (some lines may appear slightly more angular than normal)
* Pressure sensitivity: *NO* (Currently uses first pressure value as entire stroke width)
* Highlighter: *NO*  (opacity seems to be ignored by gnujpdf)
* Text: *NO*
* Colours: *SOME* (Basic R/G/B/Y and black. More colours can be added easily)
* Eraser: *NO*  (appears as filled stroke areas)
* Background: *NO* (just white for now)
* Embedded PDFs: *NO* (no plans to support either)
